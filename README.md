Ensemble Network Aggregation (ENA)
===

Ensemble network aggregation is an approach which leverages the inverse-rank-product (IRP) method to combine networks. This package provides the capabilities to use IRP to bootstrap a dataset using a single method, to aggregate the networks produced by multiple methods, or to aggregate the networks produced on different datasets.

Available on CRAN at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ENA/index.html.

Alternatively, you can download the latest build using the `devtools` package.

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("ENA", "QBRC")
```
